This file contains 3 main documents

1- train_test document:
-this document has the train/test model to see the accuracy and show a comparetive diagram to show Predicted values Vs. Real values
-you can simply try this model by running train_Process.py and Load_TrainTest.py files which compile all required data from all files and give the disired output



2- Final_Train document:
-this document has the full train model on all data to save the model and prepare it for future predictions
-you can simply try this model by running Process.py and Load_Train.py files which compiles all required data from all files and models will be saved on your device

3- Predict document:
-this document contains a sample of future values prediction along demand load and Production measurements as asimulation
-you can simply try this model by running Predict.py file which compiles all required data from all files and will display 
how much you are expected to produce and compare it to your demand
